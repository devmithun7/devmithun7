# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hello! I'm currently a Master's candidate in Information Systems at Northeastern University, expecting to graduate in May 2025. Iâ€™m a data-focused problem-solver whoâ€™s always looking for new ways to make technology work smarter. My background includes hands-on data engineering experienceâ€”working with SQL, Spark, and ETL/ELT pipelinesâ€”as well as integrating Python-based machine learning algorithms to deliver more insightful analytics. Iâ€™ve also explored how machine learning can optimize energy management, tackling the challenge of predicting power consumption more accurately.

What drives me is a combination of curiosity, logical thinking, and a desire to keep learning. Iâ€™ve thrived in both independent projects and fast-paced, team-based settings, where I enjoy sharing ideas and coming up with creative solutions. This blend of technical skill and adaptability is what motivates me to keep pushing the boundaries of what data and technology can do.
## ðŸŒŸ Passions and Interests

Each day, my drive for continuous learning and applying logical reasoning to drive successful outcomes keeps me motivated. I am passionate about exploring new technologies and applying my skills to solve complex problems.
